# Data-Science-Algorithms

This repo contains a bunch of algorithms in a wide range of Compuer Science fields. There will be software engineering algorithms and machine learning/data science algorithms. 
The repo is separated into a few sections: Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning (needs work), NLP (currently blank), Machine Learning: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning, and some Python notes. 
Things to be added in the future: SWE algorithms.
