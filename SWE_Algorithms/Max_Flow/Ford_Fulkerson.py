Implementation for **Ford Fulkerson's Algorithm" in Python. This is an algorithm to find the maximum flow in a flow network. 
Performance: O(FE); where F is the max_flow in the network


Implementation for **Bellman Ford's Algorithm** in Python. It finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph. The graph can be directed/undirected, and can tolerate negative weights.
No negative cycles allowed. Unlike Dijkstra which is greedy, Bellman-Ford is not greedy.
Each iteration we examine all the edges, giving the VE time complexity. 
Algorithm takes at MOST V-1 iterations.
